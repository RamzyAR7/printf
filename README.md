# Printf Project

## Overview
This repository contains a custom implementation of the `printf` function, an essential component in C programming. The `_printf` function aims to emulate the standard `printf` function's fundamental features, along with some additional functionalities.

## Project Description
`_printf` is a versatile function that handles various format specifiers. It is designed to offer a range of functionalities from basic to advanced formatting capabilities.

### Features
- **Basic Format Specifiers**: Handles characters (`c`), strings (`s`), and the percent sign (`%`).
- **Integer Handling**: Includes support for integer specifiers (`d`, `i`).
- **Advanced Specifiers**: Our implementation extends to more complex specifiers, which are detailed in the project tasks.
- **Compliance**: Adheres to the Betty coding and documentation styles for C programming.

### Requirements
- Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Code must follow the Betty style guide.
- Restrictions include no global variables and a maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Function prototypes must be declared in the header file `main.h`.

### Compilation
Your code should be compiled as follows:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c

### Usage

Include the `main.h` header file in your C program to use the `_printf` function. It is used similarly to the standard `printf`

## Acknowledgements
This project is a part of the curriculum of [ALX SE]. The `_printf` function is inspired by the C standard library's `printf` function.
