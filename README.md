## Project Overview

This project involves creating a custom `printf` function in C. Our implementation aims to mimic the behavior of the standard `printf` function, with a focus on learning and applying C programming concepts.

## Features

- Outputs data to standard output (`stdout`).
- Handles various conversion specifiers, including:
  - `c` for characters
  - `s` for strings
  - `%` for the percent sign
  - `d` for integers (in decimal)
  - `i` for integers

## Authorized Functions and Macros

- `write` (man 2 write)
- `malloc` (man 3 malloc)
- `free` (man 3 free)
- `va_start`, `va_end`, `va_copy`, `va_arg` (man 3 va_*)

## Compilation

The code is compiled with the following command:
